    <h1>Jesus</h1>
    <p>
      Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed
      historically,[f] although the quest for the historical Jesus has yielded
      some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how
      closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus, as
      the only records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels.[19][g][h]
      Jesus was a Galilean Jew,[11] who was baptized by John the Baptist and
      began his own ministry. His teachings were initially conserved by oral
      transmission[22] and he himself was often referred to as "rabbi".[23]
      Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in
      healings, taught
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah#Christianity">Messiah</a>
      in parables and gathered followers.[24][25] He was arrested and tried by
      the Jewish authorities,[26] turned over to the Roman government, and
      crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.[24] After his
      death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community
      they formed eventually became the early Church.[27]

    <h2>Jesus and his times</h2>
    <p>
      Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity in religions such as
      Manichaeism, Islam and the Bahá’í Faith. Manicheanism was the first
      organised religion outside of Christianity to venerate Jesus, viewing him
      as an important prophet.[36

    <h3>Jesus and His People</h3>
    <p>
      Christians of the time designated Jesus as "the Christ" because they
      believed him to be the messiah, whose arrival is prophesied in the Hebrew
      Bible and Old Testament. In postbiblical usage, Christ became viewed as a
      name—one part of "Jesus Christ". Etymons of the term Christian (meaning a
      follower of Christ) have been in use since the 1st century.[78]

    <h4>Jesus the Savior</h4>
    <p>
      Some early Christian groups had separate descriptions of Jesus' life and
      teachings that are not in the New Testament. These include the Gospel of
      Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and
      many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these were
      written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical
      gospels.
